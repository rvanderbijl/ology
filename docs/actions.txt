A action is something that Ology can do.  E.g.:
- Play-music, Pause-music, Stop-music
- Display Screen (X)
- Cursor-movements, "Ok"/"Enter"
Some actions, like "Display Screen" can take parameters


Actions:
- Type { ScreenSpecific, Global, HighPriority }
- QList<Input>

An input can be:
- can be multi-key (CTRL+P)
- sequence of keys (CTRL-X,CTRL-S)
- a Action (e.g. if an action is invoked, then this input is also invoked)
  (useful for having a generic action, like "left" or "right" which may not have common inputs)
