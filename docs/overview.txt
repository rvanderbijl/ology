Ology is a media center.

Created b/c of dislike of MyhTV. Some of MythTV's problems:
- no simple menu editor
- database is used 
- lot of focus on tv/pvr functionality
- can't control music when not in the music screen
- setup screens suck
- it is stupid that I have to tell it to scan for new media

Ology:
- Aims to be plugin based
- Simple configuration files

Main concepts:
- Screen: e.g. a menu, a game, music select
- Action: e.g. play music, go to menu
- StatusWidget: displays status of components, e.g. volumne, cd-inserted ...
